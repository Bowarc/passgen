# passgen
Generates a random (ish) password.
This is a command line tool please run it from the console.
(Please recompile the program, the binary contains outdated code.)

### Purpose:
Generates a password (I don't know if it is trustable)

### To compile for Linux
`bash build.sh` in Terminal
### To compile for Mac (if zsh)
`sh build.sh` in Terminal
### To compile for Windows
`build.bat` in Console (Modify `gcc` in `build.bat` to your own compiler)

### v2 now has:
-Command line arguments, run the program and type the name of the place where you use it (just easier to remember)
-Saves passwords in `passwords.txt`
