# passgen
Generates a random (ish) password
(Comes with MacOS Intel binaries (Itanium* mac when ), it is the unmarked `passgen` file.)

### Purpose:
Generates a password (I don't know if it is trustable)

### To compile for Linux
`bash build.sh` in Terminal
### To compile for Mac (if zsh)
`sh build.sh` in Terminal
### To compile for Windows
`build.bat` in Console (Modify `gcc` in `build.bat` to your own compiler)
Windows users run the program from Console, running the exe normally will not work.
